# Method 1: Random data generation

This is the simplest method. 
This involves generating data by sampling from statistical distributions. 

The above code generates a random dataset simulating height and weight using normal distributions. The heights are centered around 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10, and the weights are centered around 70 kg with a standard deviation of 15. A linear relationship is introduced between height and weight, so taller individuals generally weigh more. The code also adds a Gender column with randomly assigned values of “Male” or “Female.”

This method is quick and easy to implement, making it useful for basic testing or prototyping. However, it has some limitations. It doesn't capture complex relationships or real-world patterns or account for specific domain-related nuances or constraints.
